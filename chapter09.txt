Kaname and the Japanese language input revolution

Kaname did what ...?
Ky≈çkyoku Kaname?
Yes//it seems she started using it.
Ubunchu!
Are you craz...//Ow!
How come she did that!?//She's part of the arts club, right?
Right, right.
She got a used notebook for writing that had no OS and asked for a recommendation.
Good job!! (Akane)
How cruel!! (Masato)
Cup: Seaweed soup
SFX: Sniff
What's wrong?

See ... Kaname is a quiet and well-behaved girl
and in no way geeky at all, right?
To think that we live in a time//where *such* an ordinary girl is using Linux
warms my heart//And don't make me say "weird girl".
Weird girl.
SFX: Heart skipping a beat
SFX: Steps (running)
!?
SFX: Smash

Ka//Kaname!?
Lisa//This OS...

why//won't it
let me type in Japanese!?
I had a whole essay in my head but coudn't write it down and am about to forget it

ST: We're used to that.
SFX: Cough cough
I was so caught up in my work that I ...
Ordinary girl ...
Warms your heart right.

Hmmm//your desktop environment seems to be set up for Japanese so
I don't think it should be impossible to input Japanese
SFX: Cower
ST: Don't worry about it
I guess for someone who's serious about writing Anthy won't do it.
A-n-thy
What's that?
Let me explain!//A girl coincidentally sharing her name with a certain anime character
SFX: Snap
transforms typed in kana into the corresponding kanji the user wished for.//Ubunchu's kana-kanji professor!//At least that's what I learned here.
Is that the kanji you wished for?
TN: Book of Revelation (in kana)
TN: Transformation
TN: Book of Revelation (in kanji)
Looks kinda familiar.
I guess it's kind of like that
